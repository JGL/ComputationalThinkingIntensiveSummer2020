# ComputationalThinkingIntensiveSummer2020

_Lectures from the UAL week long intensive course on Computational Thinking with p5.js at UAL in July 2020._

This week-long creative computing intensive course will give participants a wide ranging knowledge of the history of creative computing, a survey of artists working in this area and advice for setting up a studio. This also includes a working knowledge of [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), a Javascript library for creative code on the web.

**What will the workshop involve?**

Our goal is for participants to be able to be critical of current creative computing practice by not only being able to code, but by having knowledge of different fields that have contributed to creative computing as well as current practitioners and studios.
