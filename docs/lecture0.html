				<h3>0. Introduce myself.</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Born in London, grew up in Wales on a mountain.</li>
					<li>BSc in Maths and Computer Science at <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial</a>, MA in Interaction Design at <a href="https://www.rca.ac.uk/">Royal College of Art</a>.</li>
					<li>One year at <a href="http://www.fabrica.it/">Fabrica</a>.</li>
					<li>Three years at <a href="http://uva.co.uk/">UnitedVisualArtists</a>.</li>
					<li>Eight years at <a href="https://vimeo.com/hellicarandlewis">Hellicar&Lewis</a>.</li>
					<li>Three years of visting lecturing at <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/architecture-spatial-and-interior-design/postgraduate/ma-narrative-environments-csm">CSM MA Narrative Environments</a> and <a href="https://www.rca.ac.uk/schools/school-of-communication/visual_communication/">RCA Visual Communication</a> and <a href=" https://joelgethinlewis.com/">working on my own projects</a>.</li>
					<li>One year as head lecturer on the <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/creative-computing/undergraduate/ual-creative-computing-institute-diploma">Diploma in Creative Computing at the Creative Computing Institute</a>. One year as the <a href="https://universaleverything.com/">Interactive Creative Director of Universal Everything</a>.</li>

				<h3>1. The aim of this course.</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Brain exploding and coding.</li>
					<li>I'm going to reference <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> a lot in this course, because I think it's one of the best things that humanity has ever made, and I wish I'd had it when I was young. Also it's free - I hated it when teachers would reference books that I couldn't afford when I was at university.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>1. The aim of this course (continued)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>There is no homework for this course. I only ask that you pay attention and ask questions if you have them. I'd really encourage you to take the time to watch the films and read the references I put up. Think of them as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#Cheat_codes">cheat codes</a> to get you to the next level quicker than I did.</li>
					<li>To <b>introduce</b> lots of interesting concepts from many areas so that you know the magic word to search for if you want to know more. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation">Obfuscation</a> is a BIG problem.</li>
					<li><b>Not</b> to teach you how to code, but to start you on that path and point you in the right direction.</li>
					<li><b>Not</b> to teach the history of art, computing or graphic design.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>1. The aim of this course (continued).</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>To teach you see problems at many levels (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction">abstraction</a>), break down problems (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science)">decomposition</a>), find the order in them (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_(psychology)">pattern recognition</a>), make solutions using a series of steps (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a>) and realise that you might be able to use that solution in lots of areas (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization">generalisation</a>).</li>
					<li>Most of all, to <b>teach</b> you to be <b>autodidacts</b>, and, as previously mentioned, to blow your mind <b>at least</b> once per lecture.</li>
					<li>First task: <b>what</b> is an <b>autodidact</b>? </li>
				</ul>
